# Features of This Site

- Its a sports camping website for school children.
- User can log in with email and google account.
- User can select Classes if they are logged in. If user are not logged in they will be redirected to login page.

- We used `MongoDB` to store website data.
- Students can Enroll a class through a payment system. (We used `stripe` as payment gateway.)
- This site allows to toggle between `dark and light` theme. It works after clicking on `toggle` button on header.
- At home page user can see an `animation` on every section.
- This site allows different `roles` of users.
- The user roles are secure. Only specific role holder can see specific page of dashboard. Ex. Student can only see `My Selected Classes`, `My Enrolled Classes` and `Payment History` pages.
- For security purpose, user will logged out after every hour. (Using `JWT`)
